 5 light weather days followed by 2 day of regular weather Storms. Less Tier 5 and 6 Storms"

The odds for tier 5 and tier 6 storms have been lowered.

 The development of this mod was done primarily using medium difficulty.

 
The forecast then calls the weather events and now instead of a take cover message it displays the name of the weather event. 


That way you can individually check any events that are not acting like they should for mod errors. The events have some controls that I could access on time but not complete control due to the randomizing nature. The storms should only last approximately 5 minutes when they occur.Tier 0 storms are set to an extremely brief period and should not even be noticed during play.
