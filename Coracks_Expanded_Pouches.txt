Coracks_Expanded_Pouches

This changes the pouches to hold anything including more pouches.
Each is can hold 70 items!
This is great for organizing a move of a base
Just create 1 pouch per workbench / cabinet.

Pouches hold 70 slots so you can move a whole standard metal cabinet plus the cabinet.
