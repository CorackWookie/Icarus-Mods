Disabled Debris, Lightning, Treetopple,Cloud and Wind effect Visuals. No Forest fires now. 5 light weather days followed by 2 days of mixed weather Storms are roughly 5 min. Less Tier 5 and 6 Storms
This also helps with people who have video card issues displaying the extra effects.
The odds for tier 5 and tier 6 storms have been lowered.

 The development of this mod was done primarily using medium difficulty.

 Lightning, Thunder, Debris and Clouds have been turned off for performance issues. Topple trees has also been turned off. So there should be no forest fires or fallen trees with this mod.

Easy difficulty for example would be tiers 0,0,0,[

Medium difficulty for example would be tiers 0,0,0,[

Hard difficulty for example would be tiers 1,1,1,[

The forecast then calls the weather events and now instead of a take cover message it displays the name of the weather event. 


That way you can individually check any events that are not acting like they should for mod errors. The events have some controls that I could access on time but not complete control due to the randomizing nature. The storms should only last approximately 5 minutes when they occur.Tier 0 storms are set to an extremely brief period and should not even be noticed during play.
