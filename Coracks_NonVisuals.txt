                     Decreased his range to make it fit my normal haha",

D_Energy - Viewed Jimk72 Craftables
D_Generator - Viewed Jimk72 Craftables
              and used as template to change power output of existing Generator and Windmill
			  
D_Itemable - Modified Jimk72 Increased Stacks changed to  250 max stacks added sponge and fur
             for me the smaller stacks are easier to divide.
