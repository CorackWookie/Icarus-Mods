This mod gives the user 4 days of light weather. The fourth day will contain an assortment of weather patterns.The built in chances for a higher or lower weather tier are also still active.
The odds for tier 5 and tier 6 storms have been lowered.

 The development of this mod was done primarily using medium difficulty.

 Lightning, Thunder, Debris and Clouds have been turned off for performance issues. Topple trees has also been turned off. So there should be no forest fires or fallen trees with this mod.

Easy difficulty for example would be tiers 0,0,0,[

Medium difficulty for example would be tiers 0,0,0,[

Hard difficulty for example would be tiers 1,1,1,[

The forecast then calls the weather events and now instead of a take cover message it displays the name of the weather event. 


That way you can individually check any events that are not acting like they should for mod errors. The events have some controls that I could access on time but not complete control due to the randomizing nature. The storms should only last approximately 5 minutes when they occur.Tier 0 storms are set to an extremely brief period and should not even be noticed during play.
