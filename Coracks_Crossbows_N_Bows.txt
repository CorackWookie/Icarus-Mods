Coracks_Crossbows_N_Bows
Original Dextermod Bifrost Modified by Corack

Crossbows are slightly stronger and all bows have a more linear progression.
Note this does not include the Bifrost Crossbow! I just used this as a guide to make this mod.

Modified Existing Crossbow and Bow stats for better progression and added Highlighted Arrows/Bolts to all
D_ItemStatic  - added Dextermod: Bifrost_Titanium_Crossbows
D_FirearmData - added Dextermod: Bifrost_Titanium_Crossbows
       used as template to only modify existing bows slightly, add Highlighted Arrows/Bolts
